    # Multiple schedules for better reliability (GitHub Actions can delay cron jobs)
    # This ensures we get runs approximately every 30 minutes even with delays
    
    # Primary schedule: Every 30 minutes at exact times
    - cron: '0,30 * * * *'    # Run at :00 and :30 of each hour
    
    # Backup schedules to catch GitHub Actions delays
    - cron: '5,35 * * * *'    # Run at :05 and :35 (5min offset backup)
    - cron: '10,40 * * * *'   # Run at :10 and :40 (10min offset backup)

    # when schedules overlap due to GitHub Actions timing irregularities
